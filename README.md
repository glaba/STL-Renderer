# STL-Renderer

This repository contains a small 3D renderer which takes STL binary files as input and renders them as PNG files using rasterization. It is a heavily modified version of a programming assignment for ECE 220H at UIUC, which involved creating simple functions to draw lines and basic shapes in 2D.
